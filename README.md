## General

### How is WebLiero different from the original DOS Liero?

Besides the obvious differences (like the fact that it's played in a browser and has online-multiplayer), here are some other differences:

* Worms have no shadows
* The random map generator uses a different (improved) terrain generation algorithm
* Maps can be mirrored to allow double the play area
* *(this list is incomplete, help me complete it)*

### Does WebLiero support loading custom Liero maps?

Yes. If you're the host of a room you can load maps in .lev format from the Admin menu.

### How can create my own maps or edit existing ones?

Check the [liero-palettes](https://github.com/pilaf/liero-palettes) GitHub repo, which contains a guide on how to edit Liero maps using available free software.

## Room List

### What are rooms with DED in their name?

DED stands for *dedicated*. Those are rooms hosted by dedicated servers and are on 24-7. Since they're on dedicated servers they tend to have good network reliability (i.e. low lag).
